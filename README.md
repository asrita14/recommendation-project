# recommendation-project
full web app
Hi,
This recommendation model was constucted to help people choose movies and avoid movies they might not like.this is a full stack Django web project with both admin access and user access seperately.
the requirements for the web app are :
> python 3
> django latest version
> sqlite
> other than the above three i have made use of many common libraries like numpy , pandas, sklearn, scipy,os , etc. 
> the csv files have to imported into local database
> django migrations will be needed to be performed (ex- python manage.py makemigration, migrate)
> some of the usrls in the files are according to the location of files in my personal laptop and might need to be changes 
> paths need to specified so as to be able to run most of the files

> the web app has two different accesses :--
  1. admin user in django administator (username- admin , password - admin)
  2. for the already in use user (username = asrita , password = bobba123)
  3. only admin user has access to  add new databases into the database .
  
  hope you found this useful .
